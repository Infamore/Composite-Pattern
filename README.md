Primary example of creating a composite pattern that represents an expression tree. An expression tree is a tree representation of an equation, so the expression will filter a class hierarchy by structuring individual composites. 

NOTE::Precluding undesirable errors requires abstract base class implementation that prevents undefined polymorphism upon compilation
